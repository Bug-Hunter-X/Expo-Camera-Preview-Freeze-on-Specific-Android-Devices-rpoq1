This bug occurs when using Expo's `Camera` API with certain Android devices. The preview freezes intermittently, and the camera becomes unresponsive. This issue is not consistently reproducible across all devices and may be related to specific hardware or software configurations.  The error doesn't manifest itself with a clear error message in the console, making debugging challenging. The preview simply stops updating, and the app becomes unresponsive to further camera actions.  This bug does not affect iOS devices. 

```javascript
// buggy code
<Camera type={Camera.Constants.Type.back} style={styles.camera} onCameraReady={() => setCameraReady(true)}/>
```
